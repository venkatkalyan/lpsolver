LP Solver is a java-based program designed to solve rudimentary linear programming problems by the simplex method.  This project is currently in early alpha development.

This project is intellectually based on [An Introduction to Linear Programming and Game Theory](https://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/books/newTitles200808/0-470-23286-2/description/?sID=lcezeae3m3tsuadl7kte2852zq) by Paul Thie and Gerard E. Keough.  The GUI components are in part inspired by Gerard Keough's [LP Assistant](http://www2.bc.edu/~keough/software.html).

<br><i><u>Features Include:</u></i>
<ul>
<blockquote><li>Solve linear programming problems</li>
<li>Find Sensitivity Data, including reduced cost, shadow price, slack and surplus</li>
<li>Open solving structure; a console displays the steps taken to solve a given problem</li>
<li>Auto-generated LaTeX code of the input model and simplex tableaus</li>
<li>Easy to use GUI</li></ul></blockquote>

You can find the source code for the underlying solver class on <a href='https://github.com/gthole/lpp'>github</a>.<br>
